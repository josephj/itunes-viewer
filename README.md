## What we're assessing

Not only JavaScript ðŸ™‚. We're looking for a good demonstration across all areas of front-end development, e.g.:

- How well you can write semantic HTML.
  - Headings, `<header/>`, `<main/>`, `<footer/>`
- How well you can write and organise CSS.
  - [Style System](https://styled-system.com/) with Chakra UI library.
- How well you can componentise a UI.
  - `component`: Reusable UI library
  - `modules/<feature>`: Orgainised by feature
- How well you can optimise for performance.
  - Plan to use **GraphQL** to reduce duplicate call.
  - Plan to use more **SSR** in the first load.
